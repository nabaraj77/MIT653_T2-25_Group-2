### **Section B: Survey Design**

**Research Question:** How can AI and machine learning improve the detection and mitigation of cyber-attacks, such as phishing and ransomware, within hospital information systems?

***

### Objectives of the Survey

Our research will be a **descriptive** and **correlational** study. The main goal is to gather the perceptions and experiences of cybersecurity professionals working in healthcare.

The specific objectives are:
* To find out how widely AI and machine learning security tools are currently used in hospital information systems.
* To measure how effective professionals believe these tools are at stopping phishing and ransomware.
* To identify the biggest benefits and challenges of using AI security tools in a hospital setting.

***

### How the Survey Will Be Conducted and Distributed

* **Method:** We will use an **online survey** created with a platform like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey. Online surveys are **efficient** for collecting data from professionals in different locations.
* **Distribution:** Because our target audience is very specific, we will use **convenience sampling** to distribute the survey. We will share the survey link on professional networks like LinkedIn and in relevant online groups for healthcare IT professionals.

### Selected Sample for Your Survey

* **Participants:** The survey is for **IT and cybersecurity professionals** who have experience working with Australian hospital information systems.
* **Sample Size:** We will aim for **50-100 qualified respondents**. While the goal is always to have a sample that can **represent the population**, a smaller, targeted sample is more realistic for this specialized group.
