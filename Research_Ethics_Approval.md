# 2. Project Overview
**Research Objectives:**  
a) To determine the current adoption rate of AI/ML cybersecurity tools in Australian hospitals.  
b) To measure the perceived effectiveness of these tools in detecting and mitigating phishing and ransomware.  
c) To identify the primary benefits and challenges associated with implementing AI/ML security systems in a hospital environment.  

**Research Questions/Hypotheses:**  
How can AI and machine learning improve the detection and mitigation of cyber-attacks, such as phishing and ransomware, within hospital information systems?

# 3. Methodology
**Research Design:**  
The study uses a mixed-methods research design. It is primarily quantitative, using a survey with closed-ended questions to collect numerical data for statistical analysis. It also includes a qualitative component, with one open-ended question to gather descriptive, contextual insights.

**Participant Recruitment:**  
Participants will be recruited using convenience sampling. A link to the online survey will be distributed on professional networking platforms (e.g., LinkedIn) and in relevant online communities for IT and cybersecurity professionals working in the Australian healthcare sector.

**Sample Size:**  
The target sample size is 100 participants.

**Data Collection Methods:**  
Data will be collected via a self-administered online survey created using a platform like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey. The survey consists of 7 closed-ended (quantitative) questions and 1 open-ended (qualitative) question.

**Data Analysis Plan:**  
Quantitative Data: The quantitative data from the closed-ended questions will be analyzed using Microsoft Excel. PivotTables will be used to generate descriptive statistics (counts, percentages) for each question, and PivotCharts will be created to visualize the results.  
Qualitative Data: The qualitative data from the open-ended question will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify recurring themes and key insights.

# 4. Ethical Considerations

## 4.1. Voluntary and Informed Participation
**How will you provide clear, accessible information to participants?**  
An information sheet will be provided on the first page of the online survey. It will clearly explain the research purpose, the voluntary nature of participation, how data will be used, and the participant's rights.

**How will you obtain and document informed consent?**  
Informed consent will be obtained via a checkbox on the first page of the survey. Participants must tick a box stating, "I have read the information provided and I consent to participate in this research," before they can proceed to the survey questions.

**How will you ensure participants can withdraw freely at any stage?**  
The information sheet will explicitly state that participation is voluntary and that participants can close the browser to withdraw from the survey at any time without penalty.

## 4.2. Minimising Harm and Discomfort
**What potential risks (psychological, physical, legal, cultural, or social) exist?**  
There is a minimal potential risk that participants may feel uncomfortable answering questions about their organization's cybersecurity practices. There are no psychological, physical, or other significant risks.

**What steps will you take to reduce or manage these risks?**  
To manage this risk, the survey will be completely anonymous. We will not ask for participants' names, their employers' names, or any other identifying information. This ensures they can answer honestly without fear of professional repercussions.

## 4.3. Protecting Confidentiality and Privacy
**How will you store, protect, and limit access to personal data?**  
No personal data will be collected. The anonymous survey data will be stored in a password-protected cloud folder, and access will be strictly limited to the student researchers and the project supervisor.

**Will the study be anonymous or de-identified? If not, why?**  
The study will be fully anonymous.

## 4.4. Ensuring Fair and Respectful Treatment
**How will you ensure inclusivity, fairness, and cultural sensitivity?**  
The survey will be distributed online, making it accessible to professionals across Australia regardless of their location. The language used in the survey will be neutral and professional, avoiding any culturally insensitive or biased terminology.

**How will you prevent bias or unequal treatment?**  
All participants will receive the exact same survey and information. The convenience sampling method is open to any professional in the target group, ensuring no specific individuals or organizations are unfairly targeted or excluded.

## 4.5. Honesty with Professional Colleagues
**How will findings be reported with transparency and integrity?**  
The findings will be reported honestly and accurately in our final research report. Both the quantitative results and the qualitative themes will be presented, including any findings that may not support our initial assumptions.

**How will you acknowledge contributions from colleagues, supervisors, and participants?**  
We will acknowledge the guidance of our project supervisor, Dr. Lien Nguyen, in our final report. We will also thank the anonymous participants for their valuable time and contributions in the introduction to our analysis.

# 5. Data Management
**Data Storage:**  
The anonymous, aggregated survey data will be stored on a password-protected cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive) for the duration of the project. It will be retained for the assessment period of this unit only.

**Data Security:**  
The data will be secured via the password protection of the cloud storage account. Only the student researchers and the project supervisor will have the password to access the data.

**Data Disposal:**  
The digital data file will be permanently deleted from the cloud drive and local computers within one month of the final submission of our research project.
