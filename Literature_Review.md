Literature Review: **Emerging Technologies and Cybersecurity Challenges in Healthcare**   By: Nabaraj Dahal


**1.	The Evolving Threat Landscape in Healthcare**
The sensitivity of patient information and vital medical facilities exposes the healthcare organizations to extreme cyber threats.
The most serious are:
•	**Ransomware:** Ransomware tends to dominate the healthcare cyberattack and cripples services (e.g., delayed surgeries), causing a threat to patient safety.
•	**Phishing & Social Engineering:** Phishing is still among the leading vectors of attack, and spear phishing, and clone phishing use trusted channels to acquire credentials.
•	**IoT/Medical Device Vulnerabilities ("Medi-Jacking"):** Infected IoT device (e.g. infusion pump, pacemaker) can be controlled remotely, a potentially life challenging issue.
• **Data Breaches:** If the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) access is not authorized, data breaches continue to occur thanks to certain third-party breaches and ransomware-based theft.
•	**DDoS Attacks:** These strike with the aim to overload networks leading to outages that slow the process of accessing patient records and apps that are critical.

**2.	Emerging Technologies for Cyber Defence**
• **Block chain:** Tamper resistant storage of health records, more integrity of information and patient privacy. It decreases the attack zones that are centralized and facilitates the sharing of data in a secure way.
•	**Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML):**
          o**Anomaly Detection: **AI keeps watch over the traffic in networks to signal malicious threats in real-time (e.g. ransomware patterns).
          o**	Predictive Defence:** ML identifies attacks based on the past attacks.
          o	**Phishing Mitigation:** AI is capable of detecting malicious email texts with high success rate.
•	**Cloud Computing:** Provides scalable security, automatic updates and solid disaster recovery. Its decentralized storage prevents the effects of DDoS and ransomware.
•	**Homomorphic Encryption:** Has the ability to compute on encrypted data, hence privacy preserving analytics.

**3.	Regulatory Frameworks and Risk Management**
Standards are critical for systematizing defences:
•	**NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001:** Offer a patterned methodology in risk analysis, access administration and HIPAA conformity.
•	**Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA):** Tests each user / devices prior to enabling their access to the data, thus reducing the risks of breaches.
•	**Integrated Risk Models:** Insert the data about the threats and vulnerability to IoMT and cloud topologies.

**4.	Persistent Challenges and Research Gaps**
Key unresolved challenges include:
•	**Unsecured resource-challenged medical devices**Image-based medical devices do not have inherent security.
•	**Interoperable vs. Security**Interoperable data can bring security challenges opposite enduing architecture constraints.
•	**Human Factors:** Lack of Staff training exposes them to social engineering.
•	**The Ever-Changing Threat:** AI-enabled attacks and Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) have outlawed the traditional defenders.

**5.	Conclusion**
Although block chain, AI, and zero-trust architectures can provide strong protection against the healthcare cyber threats, the implementation of these strategies needs coordination with the standards related to regulatory frameworks, such as HIPAA, and vulnerabilities that may manifest in human beings. Lightweight IoMT security, threat hunting powered by AI, and uniform frameworks of cross-institutional data sharing are on the agenda in the future. Multi-layered adaptive security ecosystem should be used to protect the digital future of healthcare.
