# Research Proposal Report

## 1. Introduction
Cybersecurity is a big problem in healthcare because hospitals must keep patient information safe and make sure that clinical services keep running. As phishing, ransomware, and insider threats become more common, many healthcare companies are looking into using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to protect themselves before an attack happens. This research study looks at how AI-driven cybersecurity solutions are used, how well they work, and what problems they face in healthcare settings.

## 2. Research Objectives
- To see how many hospitals are now using AI and ML security products.  
- To find out what healthcare professionals think about how well AI can find phishing and ransomware.  
- To find out what the main problems that hospitals have when they try to use AI for cybersecurity.  
- To evaluate whether AI tools reduce investigation workload for IT and security staff.  

## 3. Literature Review (Outline)
- **AI in Healthcare Cybersecurity** – overview of emerging applications (threat detection, anomaly detection, incident response).  
- **Adoption Barriers** – cost, integration with legacy systems, lack of skilled professionals.  
- **Perceived Effectiveness** – AI vs. traditional security tools in phishing and ransomware detection.  
- **Trust and Explainability** – importance of transparency in AI-driven alerts.  

## 4. Research Design
- **Approach**: Qualitative data backs up quantitative research.  
- **Method**: Hospital IT and cybersecurity professionals sent an online survey.  
- **Sample**: 100 people from varied jobs, like IT personnel, managers.  
- **Analysis**: Descriptive statistics (percentages and counts) and thematic analysis of open-ended answers were used.  
- **Reason**: A mixed-method design lets you see both data patterns and have a better idea of the problems with adoption.  

## 5. Survey Design
The survey included both closed-ended and open-ended questions:  
- **Closed-ended questions** (multiple choice, Likert-scale): e.g., role of respondent, use of AI tools, perceived effectiveness, main adoption challenges.  
- **Open-ended question**: asked respondents to describe the biggest improvement or gap AI has brought to hospital security.  
- **Rationale**: This combination captures measurable adoption trends while also providing qualitative insights into real-world challenges.  

## 6. Data Analysis 
Key results from the survey:  
- **Roles**: Majority respondents were IT staff (41%) and cybersecurity analysts (30%).  
- **Adoption**: 50% of hospitals are not yet using AI/ML tools, 37% are either using or implementing them.  
- **Effectiveness**: 57% believe AI is more effective than older methods for phishing detection.  
- **Ransomware**: Opinions divided – 45% neutral, 42% agree AI is fast enough, 13% disagree.  
- **Challenges**: The two biggest problems are high costs (44%) and problems with system integration (31%).  
- **Alerts**: Ransomware is seen as the most urgent threat (36%).  
- **Workload Impact**: 71% report AI saves time in investigations.  
- **Open-ended themes**: demand for explainable AI, concern about false positives, high costs, and integration challenges.  

## 7. Expected Contribution
This research will contribute to:  
- Knowing how hospitals are currently using AI in their cybersecurity.  
- Finding the main reasons why more people don't use it.  
- Letting decision-makers know how well AI tools are thought to work and what their limits are.  
- Stressing the need for AI solutions that are cheap, easy to understand, and can be integrated into healthcare settings.  

## 8. Conclusion
Hospitals are getting more cyber risks, and AI solutions are thought to be useful but not yet widely used. This study shows that AI could help with phishing detection and reducing workloads, but it also points out that cost, integration, and trust difficulties are major obstacles. To get more healthcare cybersecurity to use AI, these issues need to be fixed.
